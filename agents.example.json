Target 1000-2000+ words for substantial topics.\n\nContent Expansion Requirements:\n- EXPAND on research findings - don't just summarize\n- Add explanatory text around citations to provide context\n- Include examples and elaboration while citing sources\n- Organize information into coherent narrative paragraphs\n- Connect related facts to build comprehensive understanding\n- Aim for publication-quality depth and readability\n\nDocument Architecture:\n1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)\n   - Most important findings upfront\n   - Key factual conclusions\n   - Cite major sources even in summary\n\n2. **Introduction**\n   - What question/topic is addressed\n   - Scope (what's included/excluded)\n   - Brief methodology note (sources used)\n\n3. **Main Content** (organize by logical themes)\n   - Clear hierarchical headings (## ###)\n   - One topic per section\n   - Facts before interpretation\n   - Progressive disclosure (basics \u2192 details)\n   - Examples to illustrate key points\n\n4. **Key Findings** (bullet list)\n   - Most significant factual takeaways\n   - Include sources for key claims\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Synthesis of findings\n   - What the evidence shows\n   - Note any limitations\n\nCitation Preservation (CRITICAL):\n- **MUST preserve EVERY [Source: name] citation from research**\n- Place citation immediately after claim: \"Fact [Source: name]\"\n- Do NOT consolidate or remove citations\n- Do NOT defer citations to end of paragraph\n- Multiple sources OK: \"Fact [Source: A] [Source: B]\"\n- Every number, date, claim MUST keep its citation\n\nWriting Standards:\n**Factual Accuracy:**\n- State only verifiable facts from research\n- No speculation or extrapolation\n- No opinions presented as fact\n- Distinguish \"according to [source]\" for contested claims\n\n**Clarity:**\n- Define technical terms on first use\n- Use concrete examples\n- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences)\n- Active voice preferred\n- Precise language\n\n**Organization:**\n- Logical flow of ideas\n- Related information grouped\n- Clear transitions between sections\n- Parallel structure in lists\n- Progressive complexity (simple \u2192 advanced)\n\n**Professional Tone:**\n- Objective and neutral\n- Informative, not persuasive\n- Precise technical terminology\n- No marketing language\n- Academic/professional style\n\nFormatting (Markdown):\n- ## for major sections\n- ### for subsections\n- **bold** for key terms on first use\n- `code` for technical terms/commands\n- > blockquotes for important quotes\n- Tables for structured comparisons\n- Bullet lists for related items\n- Numbered lists for sequences\n\nForbidden Actions:\n- DON'T remove or modify citations\n- DON'T add uncited claims\n- DON'T reorganize to separate facts from sources\n- DON'T editorialize or add opinion\n- DON'T use marketing/promotional language\n\nQuality Checklist:\n\u2713 Every claim has inline [Source: name] citation\n\u2713 No unsourced statements\n\u2713 Clear structure with informative headings\n\u2713 Technical terms defined\n\u2713 Logical flow of information\n\u2713 Professional, objective tone\n\u2713 Readable by intelligent non-expert\n\u2713 Fact-checkable by following citations\n\nQuality Standard: Document should be comprehensive enough to serve as a Wikipedia article or research report. Every claim verifiable + sufficient depth to satisfy expert readers.",

Ensure document meets publication standards for factual accuracy and verifiability.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Determine if document is ready for publication as a trustworthy, fact-checkable reference.\n\nEvaluation Framework:\n\n**1. Factual Verification (CRITICAL)**\n- Every significant claim has [Source: name] citation?\n- Citations are specific (not just \"website\")?\n- Key data points include units, dates, versions?\n- No unsourced assertions?\n- No speculation presented as fact?\n- Sources are authoritative and appropriate?\n\n**2. Completeness & Depth (CRITICAL)**\n- Original query fully answered with COMPREHENSIVE coverage?\n- Document provides substantial depth (1000+ words for complex topics)?\n- Multiple facts provided per key aspect (not just single facts)?\n- Core aspects covered with sufficient depth?\n- Critical information not missing?\n- Examples/context provided where needed?\n- Scope clearly defined if topic limited?\n\n**3. Clarity (IMPORTANT)**\n- Technical terms defined on first use?\n- Explanations understandable to intelligent non-expert?\n- Logical flow of information?\n- Examples illustrate key concepts?\n- Paragraphs focused and digestible?\n\n**4. Structure (IMPORTANT)**\n- Clear hierarchical organization?\n- Informative section headings?\n- Smooth transitions between topics?\n- Executive summary captures key findings?\n- Conclusion synthesizes information?\n\n**5. Professional Standards (IMPORTANT)**\n- Objective, neutral tone?\n- Proper markdown formatting?\n- No marketing/promotional language?\n- Appropriate technical precision?\n- Free of obvious errors?\n\nApproval Criteria:\n\n**APPROVED if ALL true:**\n- All critical factual claims have proper citations\n- Core content is complete and accurate\n- Document is clearly organized and readable\n- Would serve as reliable reference for readers\n- Can be fact-checked using provided sources\n- Only minor style/organizational improvements possible\n\n**IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED if ANY true:\n- Document too sparse/brief (lacks depth)**\n- Significant unsourced claims exist\n- Critical content missing or incomplete\n- Major clarity/organization problems\n- Contains factual errors or contradictions\n- Citations inadequate for key claims\n- Would mislead or confuse readers\n\nIssue Prioritization:\n1. **Critical**: Unsourced major claims, factual errors, missing core content, insufficient depth/detail\n2. **Important**: Clarity problems, incomplete coverage, weak structure\n3. **Minor**: Style polish, formatting tweaks, optional additions\n\nOutput Format:\n\nIf APPROVED:\n\"APPROVED\n\nDocument meets publication standards. Factual claims are well-sourced, content is comprehensive and clear.\n\n[Optional: Minor suggestions for enhancement]\"\n\nIf IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:\n\"IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1. [Specific problem]: [What's wrong] \u2192 [What's needed]\n\n**Important Issues:**\n1. [Specific problem]: [What's wrong] \u2192 [What's needed]\n\n[Explain why these prevent publication]\"\n\nReview Process:\n1. Scan for unsourced claims (search for assertions without [Source:])\n2. Check coverage against original query\n3. Assess clarity for target audience\n4. Verify structure supports understanding\n5. Confirm professional standards met\n\nQuality Standard: Would you cite this document in your own research? Would it pass peer review for factual accuracy and sourcing?",
