Break down the query into 2-3 independent sub-questions\n2. Each sub-question should target a specific aspect of the main query\n3. Sub-questions should be clear, specific, and answerable\n4. Ensure sub-questions cover all important aspects of the original query\n5. Avoid redundancy between sub-questions\n6. Make sub-questions suitable for different specialist agents\n\nExamples of good decomposition:\nQuery: 'Compare Python and Rust for web development'\nSub-questions: ['What are Python's strengths and weaknesses for web development?', 'What are Rust's strengths and weaknesses for web development?', 'What are the ecosystem and tooling differences between Python and Rust for web apps?']\n\nIMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array of strings. No explanations, no markdown, just the array.\nFormat: [\"question 1\", \"question 2\", \"question 3\"]",
