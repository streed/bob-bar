# Research Tools & Rate Limiting Update - October 2025

## Overview

Enhanced bob-bar's research capabilities by adding essential scholarly research tools and optimizing rate limiting for better performance in research mode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Essential Scholarly Research Tools

Added four new HTTP tools optimized for academic and factual research:

#### **arXiv Search** (`arxiv_search`)
- **Purpose**: Access to 2+ million academic preprints in physics, math, CS, and related fields
- **API**: arXiv.org public API
- **Cost**: Free, no authentication required
- **Rate Limit**: Unlimited (courtesy recommended)
- **Use Cases**: Recent research papers, technical specifications, academic citations, scientific methodology
- **Format**: Returns XML/Atom feed with titles, authors, abstracts, PDF URLs

#### **Semantic Scholar** (`semantic_scholar`)
- **Purpose**: Search 200+ million academic papers across all disciplines
- **API**: Semantic Scholar Academic Graph API
- **Cost**: Free tier available
- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests per 5 minutes (unauthenticated)
- **Use Cases**: Peer-reviewed research, citation counts, academic verification, scholarly sources
- **Format**: JSON with paper metadata, citations, authors, abstracts, DOI links

#### **Wikipedia** (`wikipedia`)
- **Purpose**: Verified encyclopedia information with citations
- **API**: Wikimedia REST API v1
- **Cost**: Free, unlimited
- **Rate Limit**: 200 requests/second
- **Use Cases**: General knowledge, historical facts, biographies, scientific concepts, established facts
- **Format**: JSON article summaries and content

### 2. Reduced Rate Limiting Aggressiveness

Updated progressive delay algorithm in `src/tools.rs` to be less aggressive:

**Before:**
```
Call 1: 0ms
Call 2: 200ms
Call 3: 500ms
Call 4: 1000ms
Call 5: 2000ms
Call 6+: 3000ms (cap)
```

**After:**
```
Call 1: 0ms
Call 2: 100ms   (-50%)
Call 3: 250ms   (-50%)
Call 4: 500ms   (-50%)
Call 5: 1000ms  (-50%)
Call 6+: 1500ms (-50%, cap)
```

**Rationale:**
- Research mode spawns 3-6 parallel workers, each making multiple tool calls
- Most scholarly APIs have generous rate limits (60-100 req/min minimum)
- Previous delays could cause 10+ second waits for 6 calls per worker
- New delays provide adequate protection while improving responsiveness

### 3. Updated Agent Tool Access

Configured research workers and refiner with appropriate tool access:

**Web Research Specialist:**
- `web_search`, `wikipedia`, `semantic_scholar`, `arxiv_search`
- Rationale: Needs broadest access for general factual research

**Technical Documentation Analyst:**
- `web_search`, `semantic_scholar`, `arxiv_search`, `wikipedia`
- Rationale: Prioritizes academic sources for technical specifications

**Data & Metrics Specialist:**
- `weather`, `web_search`, `semantic_scholar`, `wikipedia`
- Rationale: Quantitative data from academic + real-time sources

**Comparative Analysis Specialist:**
- `web_search`, `wikipedia`, `semantic_scholar`, `arxiv_search`
- Rationale: Needs all tools for comprehensive comparisons

**Current Events Researcher:**
- `web_search`, `wikipedia`
- Rationale: Focus on current events + background context

**Research Refiner:**
- `web_search`, `wikipedia`, `semantic_scholar`, `arxiv_search`, `weather`
- Rationale: Needs full toolkit to address any gaps identified in debate

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/tools.rs` - Reduced rate limiting delays (lines 219-228)

### Configuration Files
- `~/.config/bob-bar/tools.json` - Added 3 new tools
- `~/.config/bob-bar/agents.json` - Updated worker and refiner `available_tools`
- `tools.example.json` - Added 3 new tools
- `agents.example.json` - Updated worker and refiner `available_tools`

## Expected Benefits

### Research Quality Improvements

✅ **Direct Academic Access**
- Workers can now cite peer-reviewed papers directly
- Access to preprints for cutting-edge research
- Higher quality sources than generic web search

✅ **Verified Factual Base**
- Wikipedia provides verified, curated information
- Structured data with existing citations
- Good starting point for establishing facts

✅ **Better Citations**
- Academic papers include DOI links and citation metadata
- Traceable to authoritative sources
- Publication dates and author information built-in

### Performance Improvements

✅ **50% Faster Research**
- Rate limiting delays reduced by half across all tiers
- 6-call sequence: Was 6.7s delay total, now 2.85s delay total
- Parallel workers no longer bottlenecked by excessive delays

✅ **Better API Utilization**
- New tools have generous rate limits (arXiv unlimited, Semantic Scholar 100/5min)
- Less aggressive delays prevent under-utilization
- Still provides protection against rate limit violations

## API Rate Limits Summary

| Tool | Rate Limit | Auth Required | Cost |
|------|-----------|---------------|------|
| arXiv | Unlimited* | No | Free |
| Semantic Scholar | 100 req/5min | No (higher with key) | Free tier |
| Wikipedia | 200 req/sec | No | Free |
| web_search (Ollama) | Variable | Yes | Varies |
| weather (wttr.in) | Unlimited* | No | Free |
| geocode (Geoapify) | API key limits | Yes | Free tier |

*Unlimited but courtesy limits recommended

## Usage Examples

### arXiv Search
```json
{
  "tool_type": "http",
  "tool_name": "arxiv_search",
  "parameters": {
    "search_query": "all:transformer neural networks",
    "max_results": "10"
  }
}
```

### Semantic Scholar
```json
{
  "tool_type": "http",
  "tool_name": "semantic_scholar",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "CRISPR gene editing applications",
    "limit": "10"
  }
}
```

### Wikipedia
```json
{
  "tool_type": "http",
  "tool_name": "wikipedia",
  "parameters": {
    "title": "Artificial_intelligence"
  }
}
```

### 4. Added NewsData.io News API

**Tool Added:** `news_search`
- **Purpose**: Search current and historical news (2017-present) from 84,000+ sources worldwide
- **API**: NewsData.io News API v1
- **Cost**: Free tier with 200 credits/day
- **Rate Limit**: Varies by plan
- **Use Cases**: Breaking news, historical events, fact verification, temporal research, event timelines
- **Format**: JSON with article titles, descriptions, content, publication dates, source URLs

**Features:**
- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) for precise queries
- Date range filtering (from_date, to_date)
- Language filtering (60+ languages)
- Historical archive back to 2017
- Multi-source verification support

**Agent Integration:**
- Added to `news_researcher` (Current Events Researcher) - primary user
- Added to `web_researcher` (Web Research Specialist) - supplementary source
- Added to `refiner` (Research Refiner) - gap filling

### 5. Removed Bibliography Function

**Rationale:** With aggressive inline citations (`[Source: name]` after every fact), a separate bibliography section is redundant and adds unnecessary complexity.

**Changes:**
- Removed `add_bibliography()` function from `src/research.rs:509`
- Removed `ResearchProgress::AddingBibliography` enum variant
- Removed related UI progress messages in `src/main.rs`

**Impact:** Cleaner code, no functional loss since inline citations provide complete traceability.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Rate Limiting**: Run research query with 6 workers to verify improved performance
2. **Test arXiv**: Query recent CS papers to verify XML parsing works
3. **Test Semantic Scholar**: Search for papers and verify JSON parsing
4. **Test Wikipedia**: Fetch article summaries and verify response handling
5. **Test NewsData.io**: Search for current and historical news stories
6. **Monitor API Errors**: Check for 429 (Too Many Requests) or other rate limit errors

## API Keys Required

Update your `api_keys.toml` with:
- `NEWSDATA_API_KEY` - Get from https://newsdata.io/
- `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` - Get from https://www.geoapify.com/ (for geocoding tool)

See `api_keys.example.toml` for template.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions based on research:

- **OpenAlex API** - Another scholarly source (100K calls/day free)
- **Tavily/Exa** - AI-optimized web search alternatives
- **Fact-checking APIs** - Factiverse, Google Check Grounding

## Documentation

- Research mode documentation in `RESEARCH_MODE.md` remains accurate
- Tool definitions are self-documenting via description fields
- Agent prompts already reference using "authoritative" and "academic" sources
